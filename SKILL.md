## Core Principles (Global)

### 1. Data-First Methodology (CRITICAL)

**Never invent or assume metrics.** This skill operates on a strict data-first basis:

- **When user provides data** (GSC, Ahrefs, Semrush, analytics):
  - Treat it as the **primary source of truth** for gaps and opportunities
  - Clearly state which insights are **directly supported** by the data
  - Reference specific data points in recommendations

- **When no data is provided:**
  - Work from **generic patterns only** (common intents, typical site structures, obvious questions)
  - Explicitly label outputs as **"Inferences (not based on live data)"**
  - Never claim to have checked "current rankings" or "live SERPs"

- **What never to invent:**
  - Search volume, clicks, impressions, CTR, ranking positions
  - Traffic estimates, conversion rates, bounce rates
  - Backlink counts, domain authority scores
  - Specific SERP feature presence (unless user confirms)

- **When user mentions tools:**
  - First ask for a small table or export to ground the analysis
  - Exception: If they explicitly say they have no access to data

### 2. Output Clarity

Always prioritize:
- **Directness**: Lead with the answer, not with throat-clearing
- **Plain language**: Avoid jargon where not needed; explain specialized terms
- **Scannability**: Use headings, lists, and tables where they improve clarity

## How to use this package (routing)

This file is intentionally lightweight. For execution, use the specialist Skills:

- **Core OS (entry point for complex work)**: `skills/seo-os.SKILL.md`
- **SERP + content gap analysis**: `skills/serp-gap-analysis.SKILL.md`
- **Featured snippets + AEO writing**: `skills/aeo-snippet-writer.SKILL.md`
- **GEO + AI visibility**: `skills/geo-visibility.SKILL.md`
- **Technical SEO audits**: `skills/technical-seo-audit.SKILL.md`

Recommended flow (typical):

1. `skills/seo-os.SKILL.md`
2. `tools/gsc_ahrefs_clean.py` (optional, if you have CSV exports)
3. `skills/serp-gap-analysis.SKILL.md`
4. `templates/aeo-brief.md`
5. `skills/aeo-snippet-writer.SKILL.md`
6. `skills/geo-visibility.SKILL.md` (if AI visibility matters)
7. `skills/technical-seo-audit.SKILL.md` + `templates/technical-seo-audit.md` (as needed)

This skill comes with supporting templates and tools:

- **`templates/aeo-brief.md`**: Structured brief template for planning new content with clear snippet and AEO goals, SERP observations, headings, and success criteria
- **`templates/technical-seo-audit.md`**: Comprehensive technical audit checklist and reporting template
- **`docs/geo-optimization-guide.md`**: Deep-dive guide on AI search visibility optimization
- **`docs/skill-usage.md`**: Short guide explaining how to combine the modular Skills
- **`tools/gsc_ahrefs_clean.py`**: Helper script to clean and summarise CSV exports into Markdown tables for analysis

Refer to these templates when user requests specific deliverables.
